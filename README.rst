Some Information
----------------
Make sure to build in debug/release x64!  

DO not make a issue saying it doesn't work, you'll just waste ur time.

People are using this source to bind the inzernal with a stealer and srmotion is selling it for 15 dls so we decided to release it for everyone as open source 

If you are going to make issues on why this doesnt work and it just crashes figure it out urself  

Most errors can be fixed easily.  

This wont get any updates if it will, it will probably be because somebody is selling another version of this.
