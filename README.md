# HertZ-inzernal-modified.
People use this Source to bind it as a stealer and srmotion is selling it for 15 dls so we decided to release it for everyone as open source 
If you are going to make issues on why this doesnt work and it just crashes
figure it out urself 

Most errors can be fixed easily.

**DO not make a issue saying it doesn't work, you'll just waste ur time**

# I have Full Permissions to upload it from the Original creator HertZ himself.

i do not claim any rights that I've made this, all rights go to hertz.

# Make sure to build in debug/release x64!

# This wont get any updates if it will, it will probably be because somebody is selling another version of this.
